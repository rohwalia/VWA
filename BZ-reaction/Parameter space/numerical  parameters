Parameter space.py
3-D grid in parameter space is iterated: 300x300x100 (can be seen from np.linspace() in for loops)
Parameter configurations where the eigenvalues (obtained from function "eigenvalue_calc") are close to the imaginary axis are appended
and then exported to the excel file "Hopf.xlsx"

Parameter space_plotter.py
Plots the values extracted from "Hopf.xlsx" first as a scatter plot then as a triangulated surface
