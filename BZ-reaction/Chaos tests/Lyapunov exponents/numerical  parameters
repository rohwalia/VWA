Lyapunov_multiprocessing.py
This is essentially the same as Lyapunov.py, except that multiprocessing is used to compute the Lyapunov exponents values more efficiently. In addition, only the parameter
configurations below the Hopf bifurcation plane are considered.
  Solver: VODE (Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation)
  Method: BDF (Backward Differentiation Formula) - for stiff problems
  Simulation time: 100 sec
  Time step: 0.01 sec
  3-D grid in parameter space: 14x14x14
  Random initial condition tested per parameter configuration: 20

Lyapunov_plotter.py
The output from the simulation was stored in an excel file. The values were then plotted in form of a 3-D volume plot.
