Fourier transform_multiprocessing.py
This is essentially the same as Fourier transform.py, except that multiprocessing is used to compute the stability values more efficiently. In addition, only the parameter configurations
below the Hopf bifurcation plane are considered.
  Solver: LSODA from the FORTRAN library odepack (ODE in an explicit form/ switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods)
  Simulation time: 100 sec
  Time step: 0.001 sec
  3-D grid in parameter space: 50x50x50
  Random initial condition tester per parameter configuration: 50

Fourier_plotter.py
The output from the simulation was stored in an excel file. The values were then plotted in form of a 3-D volume plot.
