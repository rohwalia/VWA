Infinite_limitcycle_estimation.py
The aim was to check if the limit cycle was approaching infinity and numerically obtain the approximate border between infinite and finite limit cycles. If the limit cycle did 10
revolutions in the simulation it was considered finite.
  Solver: LSODA from the FORTRAN library odepack (ODE in an explicit form/ switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods)
  Simulation time: 1000 sec
  Time step: 0.001 sec
  3-D grid in parameter space: 100x100
  Random initial condition tested per parameter configuration: 3
The parameter configurations with finite limit cycles were exported in an excel file and plotted with Infinite_plotter.py
